## Brief description: Purposes and Process
The previous project is a high-fidelity prototype of SULA, a clothing store specialized for women who are going to get some type of breast surgery or are recoveriong from such. This prototype is meant to examine the functions of the webpage based on the personas. The prototype is created by Adobe XD and it is based on the low-fidelity prototype done in Invision. The functions that the prototype supports are based on previous testers of more robust models.

## Tasks Suppoerted by High Fidelity Prototype
- Access the main menu.
- Use the search bar.
- Add, access, edit and delete items from teh shopping cart.

## Color
The color scheme of the page was always meant to have related colors to those of breast cancer, since the majority of the customers from this page would have a experience related to it. The pink tones were aimed to be smooth so the human eye would not get tired. 

## Evidence of Accessibility (color-contrast at least) check.



## Peer Review: Impression test

## In Class Cognitive Walkthrough
Due to time change issues, I could not attend class the day of the peer-review. Because of this, I asked a friend of mine to do a Cognitive Walkthrough of my page.

## Revisions
If you have multiple versions of prototypes by reflecting the evaluation with others, provide them with the description of what you learned from otherâ€™s feedback and what you have made the changes
