# Assignment 4 - User in Context
#### Isabel Roig Penso


## Step01: Specify the main design challenge 
### 1. What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?
This project would provide a platform for midddle age women who had gone through a mastectomy or any type of surgery in their front chests to be able to find clothing items that are comfortable for them and support them with more easiness.

### 2. What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
The need of this product is to facilitate the search for comfortable products for post-mastectomy and other upper front chest surgery women and possibly increase the numner of designs, styles and quality of said products


### 3. What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The traditional solution is to browse through different departamental stores and/or clothing and lingerue brands until the user finds an item that seems to fulfill the requirements. And this is by self analyzing, since the items do not tend to specify that they are adequate for the type of support these group searches for.

### 4. What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
One of the limitations to finding these type of clothing and lingerie is that there are not a lot of variation or availability in any clothing or lingerie store. These need to have good support and need to be made of certain materials. Another limitation is that these do not tend to be designed with this group of women in mind. They are designed thinking of a general public and, by chance, qualify as good items for these women.

## Step02: Target users 
### 1. What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
- Demographics: middle age women, either working or unemployed, who had gone through an upper front chest surgery and are in need of clothing that will support and protect their recently intervened body.

- Preferences: users want to find clothe and underwear that provides extra support on their upper bodies and that are soft to their skin, since it is more delicate and cannot feel if they are being hurt in the area.

- Expertise: little to no expertise. The idea of the product is to provide a easy to navigate platform for this group of people to find their desired products.

### 2. Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
The users would do this activity if they have the need to get a mastectomy or a similar surgery. They would need to prepare a set of particular clothing and lingerie to wear during the post-surgery time, such as button-up shirts, non-closed sweaters, special sleeping accomodations and special braws that close at the front instead of the back

### 3. What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
The goal of the users would be to find their ideal lingerie and clothing items without the hardships of looking in multiple webpages or stores and evaluating if the item is adequate. The idea is to have 1 webpage with pre-approved items for this group of women.

## Step03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 
I would use the Interview research method, with the goal of investigating more of the requirements for the items that the webpage would show. What these group of women consider necessary clothing and lingerie. The interview will be led by myself. Due to the coronavirus and the hardships of communications, the interview will be answered by a 20-year-old woman who has gone under the process of a masectmoy. The idea is to evaluate the needs and requirements of the type of clothing and lingerie that this group needs.


## Step04: Plan to get into the context & write down the observation/ interview guide 
Due to social distancing, the interview will be done through Zoom. It will be recorded with a screenrecording of the zoom meeting (which will have the screen record and the video record) and a transcript. The interview will have a script with introduction, goals and contextual questions and will be treated as a conversation. 

## Step05: Interview

### 1. Contextual Inquiry Guide & User Data
Here you can find the links to the [Interview Script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EbW0K3oWbI_InY35v1aXQf4uXqmHUSxalwX8nGP6FUA/edit?usp=sharing) , [screenrecording]() and the [transcript](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WvsR7wjkicIgwP6COnxVspH_7E9FDstv3ltulCPSM_A/edit?usp=sharing) . 

## Step06: Reflection
