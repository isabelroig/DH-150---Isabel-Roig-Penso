# Assignment 4 - User in Context
#### Isabel Roig Penso


## Step01: Specify the main design challenge 
### 1. What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?

### 2. What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)

### 3. What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?

### 4. What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

## Step02: Target users 
### 1. What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 

### 2. Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)

### 3. What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)

## Step03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 
### 1. Interview with direct / passive / participatory observation.

### 2. Or something you learned on your own (refer to the field guideline by IDEO)

## Step04: Plan to get into the context & write down the observation/ interview guide 
### 1. Decide where to visit

### 2. Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do

### 3. Decide how to interact with the users 

### 4. Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)

### 5. Prepare the interview guide (examples + template here -- this guide is designed for search activity but you need to edit with your contextual questions according to the activity, not search activity, you want to learn from the users)

## Step05: Conduct the research
### 1. Visit the place

### 2. Meet/Observe the user(s)

### 3. Collect the data (record, pictures, answered_survey)

## Step06: Organize/Documentation
### 1. In github (sub)repository assignment4, create one document (either README.md or .html)

### 2. Describe your project design challenge + target user (step1+2)

### 3. Describe your research methods and plan (step3)

### 4. Provide a link to your interview/observation guide (step4) 

### 5. Digitize your notes (scan/photo) and upload your data to github

### 6. Provide a link to your representative data file(s) (step5)

### 7. Provide a link to the transcript of your interview (or meaningful dialogues/ talk-aloud during observation, useful transcript tool here) 

### 8. Write a reflection
