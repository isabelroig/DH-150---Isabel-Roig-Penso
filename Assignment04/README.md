# Assignment 4 - User in Context
#### Isabel Roig Penso


## Step01: Specify the main design challenge 
### 1. What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?
This project would provide a platform for midddle age women who had gone through a mastectomy or any type of surgery in their front chests to be able to find with more easiness clothing items that are comfortable for them and support them.

### 2. What is the basic need involved for that activity? (reference)
The need of this product is to facilitate the search for comfortable product for post-mastectomy and upper front chest surgery


### 3. What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
The traditional solution is to browse through different departamental stores and underwear brands until the user finds an item that seems to fulfill their needs. And this is by self analyzing, since the items do not tend to specify that

### 4. What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?

## Step02: Target users 
### 1. What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
- Demographics: middle age women, either working or unemployed, who had gone through an upper front chest surgery and are in need of clothing that will support and protect their recently intervened body.

- Preferences: users want to find clothe and underwear that provides extra support on their upper bodies and that are soft to their skin, since it is more delicate and cannot feel if they are being hurt in the area.

- Expertise: little to no expertise. The idea of the product is to provide a easy to navigate platform for this group of people to find their desired products.

### 2. Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)

### 3. What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)

## Step03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 
### 1. Interview with direct / passive / participatory observation.

### 2. Or something you learned on your own (refer to the field guideline by IDEO)

## Step04: Plan to get into the context & write down the observation/ interview guide 
### 1. Decide where to visit

### 2. Decide what activities to observe/ what to ask to do

### 3. Decide how to interact with the users 

### 4. Decide how to collect user data (ex. Pen-paper notes, voice/video recording, images)

### 5. Prepare the interview guide (examples + template here -- this guide is designed for search activity but you need to edit with your contextual questions according to the activity, not search activity, you want to learn from the users)

## Step05: Conduct the research
### 1. Visit the place

### 2. Meet/Observe the user(s)

### 3. Collect the data (record, pictures, answered_survey)

## Step06: Organize/Documentation
### 1. In github (sub)repository assignment4, create one document (either README.md or .html)

### 2. Describe your project design challenge + target user (step1+2)

### 3. Describe your research methods and plan (step3)

### 4. Provide a link to your interview/observation guide (step4) 

### 5. Digitize your notes (scan/photo) and upload your data to github

### 6. Provide a link to your representative data file(s) (step5)

### 7. Provide a link to the transcript of your interview (or meaningful dialogues/ talk-aloud during observation, useful transcript tool here) 

### 8. Write a reflection
