### Isabel Roig Penso - DH 150 F2020
(Possible) Title: SULA

Middle age woman brand of clothes, concentrated for formal events and outings. It will also offer bathing suits and lingerie that are comfortable for the middle-age woman. The special element of this page is that it sells clothes for women who had had masectomies. It is hard for them to use certain pieces of clothes because they have lost the feeling ability of their skin in this area, and it is hard for them to feel attractive and to reach happiness in their own bodies. There are not so many brands of clothes that have as a goal the comfort of this group. Among other difficulties that this group runs into includes lack of flexibily, pain,

### Initial Evaluation of Webpage:

The webpage is very informative of the program. It shows the services it offers, the different ways of payment through insurance or credit. The page focuses more on the ways to make an appointment and get a consult instead of the products its sells. In fact, the link for the items that are being sold onlone is found at the very bottom and it is easy to overlook. Even though it is a webpage focused for selling clothes, the section for post-masectomy clothes, especially bras, is not very well signaled. You either have to use the search box or know of the existance of this main page.

### Heuristic Principles:

#1: Visibility of system status.

The visibility of system status is very good. The webpage allows you to see where you are standing, under which subcategories you can find the webpage you are in, different browsing options and how to return to the main page. The top is filled with the main menus, including the shopping cart and an option to see your profile in the page. And on the side, you can see the nearest sudivisions of the page you are in. I would rank it with a regular.

#2: Match between system and the real world.

The words used in the webpage are very coloquial and user friendly. There are no complex nor similar words without necessity. The only place where you might encounter more complex words are in the subcategories of lingerie, to differentiate the ocassion and design; but even then, there are other words included in the description that helps you differentiate the categories. I would rank it as good.

#3: User control and freedom.

Most of the control commands work very well and are very clear. The only command that is not clear is how to return to the home page. Instead of having a clear "Home" button, the logo of the webpage (in this case, Nordstrom) works as a help button. If this button is accessed, there is no clear way to return to teh previous page without using the browser's return option. You have to access 2 subcategories to finally reach the link that will take you to the specialuzed browser for this type of clothe for the item. there is no subcategory for all items designed for post-mastectomy clothing. I would rank it as a regular.

#4: Consistency and standards.

The page is really consistent and standards

#5: Error prevention.

#6: Recognition rather than recall.

This heuristic principle is not the best on this page. As it was described in the Initial Evaluation, it is not cleared where the post-mastectomy bra section is located and how you can locate it. It is placed at the end of the page, in the same font and color as the rest of the texts, It is not located in a black box, like the "Find a store near you" feature is. The only thing that sets it apart is a delicate underline, which is not easily recognizable for the general user. I would rank it with a regular.

#7: Flexibility and efficiency of use.

#8: Aesthetic and minimalist design.

The design of the webpage is very minimalistic and aestetically pleasing. It is composed mainly of whites, greys and blacks, allowing the pictures to come up more easily to the eye and even these try to match the motive of the exact section of the page you are in, while folowing the aesthetics of the general page. In the case of the post-mastectomy page, it has images that show soothing pinks. Even the woman in the main picture of the page is earing a pink sweater. All the texts have the same fonts and ceratain preset letter sizes, having the biggest letters in the most important texts and decreasing the size of the texts as the text decreases importance. I would rank it with a very good.

#9: Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors.

#10: Help and documentation

There is a helper menu at the bottom of the page, where you can find the Customer Service
