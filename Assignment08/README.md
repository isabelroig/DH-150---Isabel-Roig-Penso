# SULA
## Isabel Roig Penso


### Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
Sula is a women's clothing store that specializes in clothing, swimsuits and lingerie for women who will go through or have gone through a upper body surgery. The clothing selection is based on these women's needs and preferences. It also provides information about these surgeries and promotes the creation of a community. This clothing store will be able to provide buying options for all the necesities of these women.

### Clear Design statement: 
It is hard for this group of women to find ideal clothes for their recoveries and future lives with their new bodies. They are entering the process with one body and exiting with a completely different one. Most of them lose the touch sense in that are and need to have specific clothes that help them stay comfortable. Most of the reason these women go through these surgeries are related to breast cancer, and a lot of information has to be learned really quickly. There are a lot of things that they need to do, so they have very little time to look for adequate clothing. There is no specialized store for this group of women, just small sections in departamental stores, so SULA will provide this group of women with this space.
