# SULA
## Isabel Roig Penso


### Introduction: a brief information about the project. 
Sula is a women's clothing store that specializes in clothing, swimsuits and lingerie for women who will go through or have gone through a upper body surgery. The clothing selection is based on these women's needs and preferences. It also provides information about these surgeries and promotes the creation of a community. This clothing store will be able to provide buying options for all the necesities of these women.

### Clear Design statement: 
It is hard for this group of women to find ideal clothes for their recoveries and future lives with their new bodies. They are entering the process with one body and exiting with a completely different one. Most of them lose the touch sense in that are and need to have specific clothes that help them stay comfortable. Most of the reason these women go through these surgeries are related to breast cancer, and a lot of information has to be learned really quickly. There are a lot of things that they need to do, so they have very little time to look for adequate clothing. There is no specialized store for this group of women, just small sections in departamental stores, so SULA will provide this group of women with this space.


### Competitor Analysis: [Heuristic Evaluation](https://github.com/isabelroig/DH-150---Isabel-Roig-Penso/tree/main/Assignment01)
Summary and link to the heuristics and usability testing of the *existing* product(s) - or the *original* website you evaluated

When designing a clothing website, it is important to evaluate similar competitors, analyze their strengths and weaknesses so your product beats the former and improves the later. In the case of clothing store for women with upper body surgeries, there is not a specific store they can use. The best resource to find products for these women would be sections of departamental stores, such as [Nordstrom](https://www.nordstrom.com/browse/women/clothing/underwear-lingerie/breast-prosthesis-program) and [Target](https://www.target.com/c/mastectomy-swimsuits-women-s-clothing/-/N-e5wla). The heuristic evaluation was done to these webpages since these are the closest competitors to what would be a specialized post-breast surgery and recovery store.


### Competitor Analysis: [Usability Testing](https://github.com/isabelroig/DH-150---Isabel-Roig-Penso/tree/main/Assignment02)
After our initial findings of the heuristic evaluation, we conducted the pilot usability test and gather more information for our reserch. During the pilot usability test, the researches oberves the webpage and its accessoryhas and how easy are for the daily user to use. This is an opportunity for the researcher to analyze the page from the point of view of a non-trained individual. The usability test wa sperformed in [Nordstrom](https://www.nordstrom.com/browse/women/clothing/underwear-lingerie/breast-prosthesis-program), since there are not a lot of options when it comes to specialized post-upper body surgery stores and it was the one that performed the best in the heuristic evaluation. 


### User Research: [Contextual Inquiry](https://github.com/isabelroig/DH-150---Isabel-Roig-Penso/tree/main/Assignment04)
The *user research* is a way to recieve and understand the point of view of a person that is part of the desired dedmographic of customers. It is based on the results of the *heuristic evaluation* and the *usability testing*. The user research section of the project allows a lot of flexibility when it comes to the method selected. The chosen method for this study was interview. The interview consisted of a series of contextual inquiry questions and hardships with her experience and how it can be improved. It also included a small UT section, with teh goal of understanding the familiarity of the demographic group with the competitor. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the interview took place through Zoom.
