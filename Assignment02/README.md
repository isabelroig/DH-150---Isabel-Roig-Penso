# Assignment 2

## 1. Analisis of Heuristic Deficiencies: One paragraph explaining the purpose of UT, how & what you want to test especially based on the findings of heuristic evaluation. 

Norstrom is a multidepartamental store where clothing and shoes are sold for men, women and children. In the main page of the site, you can reach items on categories like gender, item type, brand, color, size, etc. You can also use the search box if you are looking for an especific item or search individual sections of the page. The store has a specialized department for post-masectomy women underwear called. This items are designed to be more gentle to the women's upper body. We will be performing a usability test to the Nordstrom webpage, to the Breast Pristhesis Program. 

The goal of the usability test is to evaluate the webpage's interface for flaws and usability through a series of tasks designed to test the suspected flaws, with the objective of improving the user's perspective. We do this by asking a less trained mind to perform the designed tasks and evaluating their response. These tests tend to be recorded for reference and analysis.

The usability principles that will be evaluatied during this UT experiment will be:
- #6: Recognition rather than recall
- #10: Help and documentation
- #3: User control and freedom

This heuristic principles were chosen to study because these are the ones that were not completey satisfied in the previous evaluation. There were some problems and difficulties when evaluating these and this is a good way of confirming those conclusions.

I will work as moderator while my roommate, Rebeca Ruiz,  will be the participant. The UT will take place in her private room, where no interruptions or distractions will happen.

The process of the usability test will be the following:
- Introdduction
- Consent
- Backgroud Questions
- Pre-test Questionnaire
- Tasks
- Post-test Questionnaire
- Product Satisfaction Card
- Demographics Questionnaire

## 4. Reflection: One paragraph describing what you learned during the pilot test, what went well and what went not so well, focusing on how you want to improve your UT in the future.
Conducting the UT was a eird experience. I would have the urge to guide the participant to hint what she had to do. The participant struggled a lot using the page, which surprised me since it is a very populat page. I struggled a lot when the user was not able to complete the task or if she did it wrong. I promted the participant to read the questions very well so that she would be able to complete the tasks. At the beginning, the participant was not being very vocal about her through procefss and I attempted to encourage it reminding her that we were evaluating the site and not her.

The participant found the test rather challenging. She even expanded the browser with the webpage to be able to navigate it better, which did help.

I learned that there is a serious recognoition rather than recall problem. The user found it rather hard to recognize where the mastectomy section was. There was also a user control and freedom issue, since the participant did not feel comfortable with the filters. There were also some documentation problems since the participant struggke to find the information, yet this might eb because of the fortmat the webpage used, which she complained a lot about. The UT showed me the severity of the issues.
